A quick bootstrap site that's a work in progress. It's for a business that I may be starting up soon, I'll keep it updated.
The CSS and everything is all in the HTML file, I know that using external styling is better but I'm just keeping it like this while I only have one page. Once I have built the other's I shall change it, however I have a lack of designs for the other pages, might make it a paralax site to keep it consistant.
